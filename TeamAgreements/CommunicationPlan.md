* Hugo: I will always be available to communicate. Work hours will be from 9AM to 10PM.
* Diogo: I will try to be available as best as I can due to work. Will be more available for work hours after 5PM, but most of the week besides Wednesday, I will try to be available during the day as well.

**What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?**

* Slack, Remo, WhatsApp, SMS, Discord.

**How often will you take breaks?**

* Sérgio: Sundays, I tend not to spend a lot of time in front of the computer, unless urgent.
* Hugo: Saturday and Sunday from 10am – 8pm.
* Diogo: Friday night

**What is your plan if you start to fall behind?**

* Sérgio: Ask my project/course colleagues as well as TA for help, work locally outside work hours if needed.
* Hugo: Get feedback from my colleagues and ask for guidance and help.
* Diogo: Talk with my colleagues about my work, why I’m struggling, and ask for help.

**How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?**

* Sérgio: I will always be available for a quick message and to help a colleague either via Slack, WhatsApp, SMS, Discord.
* Hugo: I will always be available to respond to emails and Slack.
* Diogo: Will always be available through Slack, Discord, WhatsApp, SMS or calls.

**What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?**

* At the conclusion of each workday, we will create point-of-situation summaries so that we are always aware of one another's progress and any assistance that may be required. Everyone will be aware of one other's challenges and achievements in this way.

**How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?**

* Sérgio: By having an open-door policy to all questions and problems, making sure that there are no silly questions and that all questions are valid, as well as actively asking how the progress of each task is.
* Hugo: I'll constantly seek their feedback. We need to know everyone's opinions because we are a team and the project depends on it.
* Diogo: Will ask my team for their opinion, be open-minded.
