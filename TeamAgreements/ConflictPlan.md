# Conflict Plan

**What will be your groupâ€™s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?**

Having an opinion is the greatest method to overcome problems. Making sure everyone shares their thoughts, and we are in constant communication will make sure conflicts do not arise and if they do we will make sure to talk it thoroughly before escalating it to TAs.

**What is your opinion about this? - What are the reasons you think that it is a good/better idea? - In the context of the project, do you think it makes sense?**

It is important to share ideas and be in the same boat in order to reach a good port.

**What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?**

This was the group's initial discussion topic. Not leaving anyone behind was the concept.
Given that this is a team project, we must complete it as a unit rather than trying to stand out among our colleagues to make a point.

**How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project, knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?**

To better understand what each of our colleagues are working on at any given time, we will make sure to inquire about their projects. In addition, we must be patient with one another. Prior to diving into the details, it's critical that everyone has a high-level understanding of the project and the concept driving it.

**How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?**

We are all committed to this training, and we are familiar with one another. This won't be a problem, but if it does, the objective is to meet with that team member and find out why. If there is a simple fix, we can work on it to make everyone's work better.

**How, and when, will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?**

The secret is to maintain our composure and quickly deescalate any kind of disagreement. We will face numerous obstacles and challenges during our professional life. In actuality, this is only the beginning, thus it's critical to begin responding to it better. The optimum course of action is a 2 to 1 or 3 to 0 vote to escalate to either a TA or the lecturer in the uncommon event that a conflict becomes intractable.
