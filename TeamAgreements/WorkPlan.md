# Work Plan

**NOTE:** While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

**How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?**

* We may determine which tasks need to be completed by reading the executive summary together and creating a network topology of what is needed. From there, we can try to use our individual skills to assign those tasks in accordance with everyone's preferences. When a team member completes a task and the other members confirm that it meets the project's requirements and is operating flawlessly, we will know that the task is finished.

**What project management tool will be used?**

* GitHub, link for our project will be: Chewy Security AWS
