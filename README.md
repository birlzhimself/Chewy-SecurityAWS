# Chewy-SecurityAWS

## Overview

As part of their growth strategy, Chewy's execs would like to start expanding sales to Europe. Unfortunately they've encountered a snag in the process: GDPR. "We've never dealt with consumer privacy regulations until recently as we've expanded our shipping clientele to the international marketplace," says Chewy's CEO. "I'm hoping our new cybersecurity consultants can implement some systems and processes that will not only keep us GDPR compliant but also let customers know that Chewy is a brand that takes their data privacy seriously."
