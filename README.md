# Chewy-SecurityAWS

## Overview

Chewy's executives want to start increasing sales to Europe as part of their expansion strategy. Regrettably, GDPR has caused a hiccup in the process. The CEO of Chewy explains, "Up until recently, when we expanded our shipping clients to the worldwide market, we've never dealt with consumer privacy regulations. "I'm hoping that our new cybersecurity consultants can put in place some systems and processes that will keep us GDPR compliant and also show customers that Chewy is a company that takes their data privacy seriously," said the new hire.

## Project Objectives:

The goal of Chewy Security AWS is to safeguard personally identifiable information (PII) and payment card industry (PCI) data while enabling Chewy's development into Europe and maintaining GDPR compliance. The project's goal is to showcase a strong cybersecurity infrastructure in the AWS Cloud, demonstrating the application of several security mechanisms to stop illegal access and data exfiltration.
