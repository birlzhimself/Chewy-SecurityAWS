## Project Name: Chewy Security AWS

### Summary of Idea:

The goal of Chewy Security AWS is to safeguard personally identifiable information (PII) and payment card industry (PCI) data while enabling Chewy's development into Europe and maintaining GDPR compliance. The project's goal is to showcase a strong cybersecurity infrastructure in the AWS Cloud, demonstrating the application of several security mechanisms to stop illegal access and data exfiltration.

### Problem/Pain Point:

With Chewy's entry into the European market came the difficulty of adhering to GDPR guidelines and protecting client data. By offering a solution that guarantees data privacy, fosters consumer trust, and positions Chewy as a company dedicated to protecting sensitive data, Chewy Security AWS addresses this pain issue.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP) Definition:

IAM Best Practices: Implement effective AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) employing best practices, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), limiting use of root access, and giving team members the right level of access.

CIS-Compliant Data Server: Establish a safe Linux server instance on AWS and encrypt PII and PCI data in transit and at rest in accordance with CIS regulations.

SIEM/Log Aggregation: Set up a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, such as Elastic Stack, CloudWatch, or Splunk Enterprise, to ingest real-time event logs from crucial assets. Simulate an attack on PII/PCI data, causing SIEM warnings to go out for quick action.

Utilize VPC Flow Logs and other pertinent tools for cloud monitoring to record and examine network traffic in AWS and explain how data exfiltration attempts are discovered. Use AWS Lambda functions to automate reactions to risks found.

DLP Controls: To detect and stop the unlawful exfiltration of PII and PCI data, implement a Data Loss Prevention (DLP) solution on a selected transport protocol. Showcase how well the DLP controls work to prevent data leaks.

Demonstrate innovation by using a new tool, system, or technique that deviates from the norm and is addressed in the course. Showcase a creative strategy to improve capabilities for threat detection, incident response, or data security.

By showcasing the aforementioned MVP components, Chewy Security AWS demonstrates a strong security architecture that supports GDPR compliance, safeguards PII and PCI data, and positions Chewy as a dependable company that values consumer confidence and data privacy.
